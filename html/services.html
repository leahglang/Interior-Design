    <h1>Budget planning</h1>
        <h2 class="t2">Interior design price | Preparing a budget for home renovation</h2>
        <p>The renovation budget is a particularly sensitive issue. <br>
            Like everyone else, we want everything and the best - and all this on a low renovation budget. <br>
            So how to estimate the cost of home renovation?</p>
        <div>
            <p>As mentioned, the renovation budget is a problematic and complex issue and there is no one right answer for everyone.</p>
            <p>The cost of home renovation is derived from the costs of the professionals you choose. <br>
                Some of the Rays are more expensive and some are less. <br>
                Many times the price can also suggest to us different work qualities.</p>
            <p>The renovation budget is also affected by choices made in favor of raw materials and finishes.</p>
            <p>Every choice we make has an impact on the budget.
               Where will we invest and choose a high standard? <br> 
               And where will we decide to "turn a blind eye" and choose a lower standard?</p>
        </div>
        <p>It is recommended that before you arrive at quotes for a contractor, <br>
            you start the renovation process with an interior planning and design service with an experienced and good interior designer. <br>
            A good interior designer will put together the best options for you under the budget definition. <br>
            This way you will have a minimum of deviations with the various professionals during the renovation.</p>
